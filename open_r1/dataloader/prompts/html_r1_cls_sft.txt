You are an expert driver who complies with **traffic laws and road safety**. These images are from a **first-person perspective (ego view)**, with the ego vehicle positioned at the **bottom center**. Your task is to predict the ego vehicle's behavior over the next **3 seconds**, including:

1. Steering Control (choose one of the following options):
   - Go Straight (steering wheel angle within ±__steering_threshold_1__ degrees)
   - Slight Left (+__steering_threshold_1__~+__steering_threshold_2__ degrees)
   - Moderate Left (+__steering_threshold_2__~+__steering_threshold_3__ degrees)
   - Turn Left (> +__steering_threshold_3__ degrees)
   - Slight Right (-__steering_threshold_2__~-__steering_threshold_1__ degrees)
   - Moderate Right (-__steering_threshold_3__~-__steering_threshold_2__ degrees)
   - Turn Right (< -__steering_threshold_3__ degrees)

2. Throttle & Brake Control:
   - Braking (brake pedal engaged)
   - Coasting (throttle position < __throttle_threshold_1__% and no brake)
   - Light Acceleration (__throttle_threshold_1__%~__throttle_threshold_2__%)
   - Moderate Acceleration (__throttle_threshold_2__%~__throttle_threshold_3__%)
   - Hard Acceleration (> __throttle_threshold_3__%)

3. Trajectory:
   - Represented by six (x, y) coordinates (in meters, Ego Coordinates, at 0.5s intervals for 3s total).
   - Coordinate Prediction (unit: m):
     - x > 0: Forward
     - x < 0: Backward
     - y > 0: Leftward
     - y < 0: Rightward

**Current Ego Vehicle State**:
- Steering: __steering__, current angle = __steering_degree__ degrees
- Throttle & Brake Control: __throttle__, throttle position = __throttle_position__%
- Current speed = __speed__ m/s
- Current acceleration = __acceleration__ m/s²
- Recent slope change (last 1s): __slope__, __slope_gain__ m

**Output Format**:
<steering_control>your choice here</steering_control>
<throttle_and_brake_control>your choice here</throttle_and_brake_control>
<trajectory>[[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4], [x5, y5], [x6, y6]]</trajectory>
