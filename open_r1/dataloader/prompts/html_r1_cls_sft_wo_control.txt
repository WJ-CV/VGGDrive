You are an expert driver who complies with **traffic laws and road safety**. These images are from a **first-person perspective (ego view)**, with the ego vehicle positioned at the **bottom center**. Your task is to predict the ego vehicle's behavior over the next **3 seconds**, including:

1. Steering Control (choose one of the following options):
   - Go Straight
   - Slight Left
   - Moderate Left
   - Turn Left
   - Slight Right
   - Moderate Right
   - Turn Right

2. Throttle & Brake Control:
   - Braking (brake pedal actively pressed)  
   - Coasting (no throttle input and no brake applied)  
   - Light Acceleration (gentle throttle input, gradual speed increase)  
   - Moderate Acceleration (noticeable throttle input, steady speed buildup)  
   - Hard Acceleration (strong throttle input, rapid speed increase)  

3. Trajectory:
   - Represented by six (x, y) coordinates (in meters, Ego Coordinates, at 0.5s intervals for 3s total).
   - Coordinate Prediction (unit: m):
     - x > 0: Forward
     - x < 0: Backward
     - y > 0: Leftward
     - y < 0: Rightward

**Current Ego Vehicle State**:
- Current speed = __speed__ m/s
- Current acceleration = __acceleration__ m/s²
- Recent slope change (last 1s): __slope__, __slope_gain__ m

**Output Format**
<steering_control>your choice here</steering_control>
<throttle_and_brake_control>your choice here</throttle_and_brake_control>
<trajectory>[[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4], [x5, y5], [x6, y6]]</trajectory>
